just follow the below steps:

step1: check if you have installed NodeJs, if not please install (it is the base for most of the JS frameworks to run, manage.. etc)
       https://nodejs.org/en/download/
step2: clean cache using "npm cache clean" this command (it is important to avoid future issue while installing)

step3: check your password contains any special characters (password: which is used to login or to authenticate the proxy n/w)
        if any special characters convert those characters to url encoded format
         example: 
                  1.
                    original password:myPass1! 
                    converted password will be : myPass1%21
                 2.
                    original password:myPass1@ 
                    converted password will be : myPass1%40
       step3 is applicable for who's password has special characters.
       
stpe4: now we need to execute following commands
      before executing these commands please get the proxy url of your n/w
      npm config set proxy http://username.password@host.portnumber (this is to download http libraries)
      npm config set https-proxy http://username.password@host.portnumber (this is to download https libraries)
      example: 
              npm config set proxy http://user1:myPass1%21@abc.com:80
              npm config set proxy https://user1:myPass1%21@abc.com:80
              
              here
              username                      : user1
              password(after conversion)    : myPass1%21
              host                          : abc.com
              port number                   : 80
       note: make sure no spaces between username, password, host and portnumber
       
 stpe5: now you can install any nodejs packages
        example: npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
